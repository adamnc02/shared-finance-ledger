// Transactions → Transfers, grouped by where the money comes FROM.
//
// The page shows one tile per From location (Current Account, the joint
// account, each savings pot, each pot), and the transfers leaving it in a
// panel beneath. This file decides which group every transfer belongs to
// and what each tile's figure is. It is a pure function of lists the page
// has ALREADY filtered for visibility (TECHNICAL.md §47 "Household page
// visibility" — a page-level filter that lib/ never applies) — it never
// filters anything itself, so a transfer the page passes in always lands
// in exactly one group.
//
// 🚨 A group is keyed on the transfer's own `fromLocation` /
// `transferFrom`, never on the derived `location` or the flat
// `potId`/`savingsPotId`. Those cannot represent both ends of a Pot → Pot
// transfer, and the derived location says which LEDGER a transfer is on,
// not where it starts (TECHNICAL.md §20 "Transfers").
//
// 🚨 The tile's figure is per PAY CYCLE: what each recurring transfer
// moves in the CURRENT cycle of its OWNER (payCycleForTemplate). Not a
// monthly equivalent, which would be a figure no payment ever matches,
// and not the viewer's cycle — a payday-following transfer lands on its
// owner's payday, whoever is looking (TECHNICAL.md §20).
